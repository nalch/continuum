Based on the idea and rules of [kraiz](https://github.com/kraiz)


## Docker

The project can be run in a docker container using the provided dockerfile.
- change into project directory
- docker-compose up -d
- call http://localhost:8300

## Development

- Server: Node.js
- Client: AngularJS
- Tests: Mocha, Chai, Sinon, ESLint

### Tests

The tests are run via Mocha and Chai and reside in the test subfolder.
To run the tests with a local npm, run the mongodb service and call `npm test` and `npm run-script lint`.

Otherwise start the services, enter the nodejs service and call
```
  docker-compose exec nodejs /bin/bash
  npm test
  npm run-script lint
```

### Codestyle

The codestyle is enforced via eslint. The stylebundle is eslint-config-google, with
a modified linelength of 120.
The imports should follow the order and be ordered alphabetically inside their blocks:
```
var npmModule = require('npm-package');

var npmModuleClass = require('npm-package').Class;

var ownModule = require('../own/module');

var npmModuleClass = require('../own/module').Class;
```
